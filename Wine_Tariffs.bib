	abstract = {This paper estimates changes in demand for imported wines by source country and resulting welfare effects due to Section 301 tariffs imposed on certain European wines in October 2019. A two-stage expenditure allocation scheme is used to estimate the import demand for red, white, and other wines in the first stage, and source-differentiated red wine and white wine demand in the second stage. From derived price elasticities measuring first and second stage interactions, welfare measures are simulated capturing effects of the new tariffs on both taxed and non-taxed exporters as well as the US importers of red and white wine.},

	abstract = {In this analysis we seek to investigate the impact of various import tariffs on trade as a percentage of GDP. Members of the World Trade Organization (WTO) set up defined tariffs to help facilitate trade with one another. There are specific guidelines for joining, namely the equitable tariff limits that disallow discrimination among countries. These universal rates allow for a firm investigation into how tariffs affect trade as percent of GDP, because it assists in diminishing the impact of substitutes among countries that are not apart of WTO. After regressing the countries’ average weighted tariff to their trade percentage of GDP it was concluded that there is a negative correlation between a country's import tariff and the amount of total trade as percent of GDP.},

First, the imposition of a tariff will generally be considered as harmful for any country. Next, we'll look at published studies focused on different countries that have used some kind of protectionist, tariff or non-tariff measure, and see the effects they have had. In the next section we will focus on Spanish exports, followed by a research to obtain data on the products that have been most affected by US tariffs, focusing on changes in exports. Later, I Will go on to analyse the results obtained and finally a brief conclusion based on what has been reached after the completion of this essay.},

	abstract = {This article empirically investigates the impact of trade barriers on the world wine trade focusing on trade costs impeding exports, including transport, tariffs, technical barriers and sanitary and phytosanitary (SPS) standards. A gravity model is estimated using data from the main importing and exporting countries for the years 1997 – 2010. The Poison pseudo-maximum likelihood estimator accounts for heteroskedasticity and the presence of zero trade ﬂows. Our results identify which regulations can adversely affect trade providing useful information to policy-makers involved in negotiations on trade frictions. While SPS measures do not seem to obstruct exports, technical barriers have a varying impact on trade. A decreasing trend for tariffs has largely been compensated by more stringent technical barriers. The overall result is that frictions in the world wine trade have not changed during the past 15 years.},

In particular, we test whether the long run pass—through of tariffs and exchange rates are identical the symmetry hypothesis. We find that this hypothesis is easily accepted in our sample. We also find that the pass-through relation varies across products, ranging from about 0.6 for trucks to unity for motorcycles. These coefficients have very different implications for trade policy. We explain the results based on demand, cost and institutional conditions in each industry. We also find weak evidence that the pass-through of exchange rates has fallen in more recent years.},

This raises questions about how tariffs affect the competitiveness of wine-exporting countries. The generalized dynamic Rotterdam model was used in estimating Japanese wine demand by source. Estimates were then used to project the impact of tariffs on imports of Australian, Chilean, French, German, Italian, Spanish, and U.S. wine. Tariff reductions primarily benefit affected countries, with limited adverse effects on competing countries. The elimination of tariffs on U.S. wine should offset any losses from competing trade agreements.},

The 2012 and 2016 antidumping duties against South Korea and China were accompanied by downward or minor price movements along with production relocation to other export platform countries. With the 2018 tariffs, on nearly all source countries, the price of washers increased nearly 12 percent. Interestingly, the price of dryers—not subject to tariffs—increased by an equivalent amount. Factoring in dryer prices and price increases by domestic brands, the 2018 tariffs on washers imply a tariff elasticity of consumer prices of above one. (JEL F13, F14, F23, L68, 019, P33)},

Over the course of 2018, the U.S. experienced substantial increases in the prices of intermediates and final goods, dramatic changes to its supply-chain network, reductions in availability of imported varieties, and complete passthrough of the tariffs into domestic prices of imported goods. Overall, using standard economic methods, we find that the full incidence of the tariff falls on domestic consumers, with a reduction in U.S. real income of \$1.4 billion per month by the end of 2018. We also see similar patterns for foreign countries who have retaliated against the U.S., which indicates that the trade war also reduced real income for other countries.},
